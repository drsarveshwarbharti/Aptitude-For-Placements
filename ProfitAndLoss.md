A shopkeeper buys an article for ₹500 and sells it at a profit of 20%.
Later, he sells another article at a loss of 10%. If the total selling price of both articles is ₹1,000, find the cost price of the second article.

Input

Practice Tip
Revise Profit & Loss formulas:

Profit % = (Profit ÷ CP) × 100

Loss % = (Loss ÷ CP) × 100

SP = CP × (1 + Profit%)

SP = CP × (1 - Loss%)
