Problem on Ages-4 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of basic linear equations.

Problem:
The average age of Ram and Shyam is 65 years.
The average age of Ram, Shyam, and John is 53 years.
What is the age of John?

Solution:
Average age of Ram and Shyam = 65
Sum of observation = Average X No of observations
So, sum of their ages = 65 × 2 = 130

Average age of Ram, Shyam, and John = 53
So, sum of their ages = 53 × 3 = 159

Now,
John’s age = (Sum of 3 persons) − (Sum of Ram and Shyam)
         = 159 − 130
        = 29 ✅

Final Answer:
👍 John’s age = 29 years
