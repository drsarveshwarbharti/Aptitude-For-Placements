Problem on Ages-2 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of basic linear equations.

Problem:
Ram is three times as old as Sam.
Two years ago, he was five times as old as Sam.
What is the present age of Ram?

Solution:
Let the present age of Sam = x
So, the present age of Ram = 3x

Two years ago:
Sam’s age = x − 2
Ram’s age = 3x − 2

According to the condition:
3x − 2 = 5(x − 2)
3x − 2 = 5x − 10
−2x = −8
x = 4

Now put the value of x back:
Ram’s present age = 3 × 4 = 12 years ✅

Final Answer:
👍 Ram’s present age = 12 years.
