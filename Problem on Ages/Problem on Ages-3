Problem on Ages-3 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of basic linear equations.

Problem:
12 years ago, the age of P was 3 times the age of Q.
After 12 years, the ratio of ages of Q to P will be 2 : 3.
What is the present age of P?

Solution:
Let the present age of Q = x
So, the present age of P = y

12 years ago:
P’s age = y - 12
Q’s age = x - 12

According to the condition-1 ( 12 years ago ):
y - 12 = 3(x − 12)
y = 3x − 24             …(i)

According to the condition-2 ( after 12 years ):
(x + 12) / (y + 12) = 2 / 3
3(x + 12) = 2(y + 12)
3x + 12 = 2y            …(ii)

Substitute (i) into (ii):
3x + 12 = 2(3x − 24)
3x + 12 = 6x − 48
60 = 3x
x = 20

Now from (i):
y = 3x − 24 = 3(20) − 24 = 60 − 24 = 36

So, P’s present age = 36 years ✅

Final Answer:
👍 P’s present age = 36 years.
