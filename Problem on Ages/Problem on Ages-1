Problem on Ages-1 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of basic linear equations.

Problem:
The present ages of A and B are in the ratio 3 : 5.
After 6 years, the ratio of their ages will be 2 : 3. 
Find the present ages of A and B.

Solution:
Let the present age of A be = 3x 
Let the present age of B be = 5x 

After 6 years, A’s age will be 3x + 6 and B’s age will be 5x + 6.
Given ratio after 6 years is 2 : 3 
So,
(3x + 6) / (5x + 6) = 2 / 3.
3 × (3x + 6) = 2 × (5x + 6).
So, x = 6.

Put the value of x back:
A = 3 × 6 = 18 years.
B = 5 × 6 = 30 years.✅ 

👍Final Answer: A is 18 years old and B is 30 years old.
