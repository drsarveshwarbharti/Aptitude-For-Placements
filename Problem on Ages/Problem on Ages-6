Problem on Ages-6 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of basic linear equations.

Problem:
The average age of a group of 4 friends is 36 years.
The youngest friend among them is 6 years old.
What was the average age of the group at the time of the birth of the youngest?

Solution:
Average = Sum of observation x No of observation
Average age of 4 friends = 36
So, total sum of age of 4 friends = 36 × 4 = 144

Youngest friend’s age = 6 years
👉 That means 6 years ago, this friend was born.

6 years ago:
Subtract 6 years from each of the 4 friends’ ages
Total sum of age of group = 144 − (6 × 4)
                          = 144 − 24 = 120

Now, we have to find the average at the time of birth of youngest
So, number of persons in the group will be = 3
Average age = 120 ÷ 3 = 40 ✅

Final Answer:
👍 Average age of group 6 years ago = 120 ÷ 3 = 40 .
