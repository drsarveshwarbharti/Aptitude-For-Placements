Problem on Ages-5 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of basic linear equations.

Problem:
The average age of 10 students and their teacher is 15 years.
The average age of the first seven students is 15 years and the average age of the last three students is 11 years.
What is the teacher’s age?

Solution:
Note : Average = Sum of observation / No. of observation.

Average of 10 students + teacher = 15
Total people = 10 students + 1 teacher = 11
Total sum of age of all (10 students + teacher) = 11 × 15 = 165

Average of first seven students = 15
Sum of first seven students = 7 × 15 = 105

Average of last three students = 11
Sum of last three students = 3 × 11 = 33

Total sum of age of all 10 students = 105 + 33 = 138

Teacher’s age = Total age of all (11 persons) − Total age of 10 students 
              = 165 - 138
              = 27 ✅

Final Answer:
👍 Teacher’s age = 27 years.
