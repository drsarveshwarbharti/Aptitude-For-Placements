Problem on Percentage-3 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of percentage and some basic calculation.

Problem:
If the price of rice is 30% less than the price of wheat, 
then the price of wheat is how much percent more than the price of rice?

Solution:
Assume price of wheat = 100
Price of rice = 100 - 30% of 100
              = 100 ‚àí 30
              = 70

Difference between wheat and rice = 100 ‚àí 70 = 30
Percentage more  = (Difference √∑ Price of rice) √ó 100
                 = (30 √∑ 70) √ó 100
                 = 42.86% ‚úÖ

üëçFinal Answer:
Price of wheat is 42.86% more than the price of rice
