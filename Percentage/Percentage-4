Problem on Percentage-4 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of percentage and some basic calculation.

Problem:
The price of apple is first increased by 10% and
then decreased by 10%. What is the change in the price of apple?

Solution:
Note: Percentage change = (Difference √∑ Original price) √ó 100
Assume price of apple = 100

Increase by 10%
Price after increase = 100 + 10% of 100
                     = 100 + 10
                     = 110
Decrease by 10%
Price after decrease = 110 ‚àí 10% of 110
                     = 110 ‚àí 11
                     = 99
Difference = Original price ‚àí Final price
           = 100 ‚àí 99
           = 1 
Percentage change = (Difference √∑ Original price) √ó 100
                  = (1 √∑ 100) √ó 100
                  = 1% ‚úÖ

üëç Final Answer:
Price of apple decreases by 1%
