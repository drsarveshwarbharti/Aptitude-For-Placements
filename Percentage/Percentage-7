Problem on Percentage-7 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of percentage and some basic calculation.

Problem:
In an election which was contested by 2 candidates, 
one candidate got 40% of total votes and yet lost by 1000 votes. 
Find the total number of votes cast in the election.

Solution:
Let total votes = 100x 

Votes received by the losing candidate = 40% of total votes
                                       = 40% of 100x
                                       = 40x

Votes received by the winning candidate = Remaining votes = 100x ‚àí 40x = 60x

Difference in votes = 60x ‚àí 40x = 20x
This difference = 1000 votes

Solve for x
20x = 1000
x = 50 

Total votes = 100x = 100 √ó 50 = 5000 ‚úÖ

üëç Final Answer:
Total number of votes cast in the election = 5000
