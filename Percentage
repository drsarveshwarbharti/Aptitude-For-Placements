Problem on Percentage - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of percentage and some basic calculation.

Problem:
An employee’s salary is increased by 12% and
then decreased by 8%.
If the original salary is ₹100, 
find the net percentage change.

Solution:
Consider Original salary = 100

Increase by 12% means 12% of 100 = 12
New salary = 100 + 12 = 112

Decrease by 8%
8% of 112 =  8.96
New salary = 112 − 8.96 = 103.04

Compare with original
Original = 100, Final = 103.04
Change = 103.04 − 100 = 3.04

Net percentage change is = Change % of Original Salary
                         = 3.04✅

👍Final Answer:Net percentage change is 3.04
