Problem on Percentage-2 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of percentage and some basic calculation.

Problem:
If 15% of y is the same as 21% of z, 
then 12.5% of y is what percent of z?

Solution:
(15/100) y = (21/100) z
y = (21/15) z
y = (7/5) z

Now, 
Let 12.5% of y = A % of z
    12.5% of y = A % of z
Substitute y = (7/5) z
12.5 % of y can be written as 1/8 of y after simplification

(1/8) √ó (7/5) z = A % of z 
A = (7/40) X 100
A = 17/5 %

Final Answer:
12.5% of y is 17.5% of z. ‚úÖ





Note: Net percentage change = ( New value - Old value / Old value ) x 100

Consider Original salary = 100

Increase by 12% 
12% of 100 = 12
New salary = 100 + 12 = 112

Decrease by 8%
8% of 112 =  8.96
New salary = 112 ‚àí 8.96 = 103.04

Compare with original
Original = 100,
Final = 103.04
Change = 103.04 ‚àí 100 = 3.04

Net percentage change is = (Change / Original Salary) x 100
                         = (3.04 / 100 ) x 100
                         = 3.04 % ‚úÖ

üëçFinal Answer:
Net percentage change is 3.04 %
