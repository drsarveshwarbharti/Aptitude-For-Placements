Problem on Percentage-2 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of percentage and some basic calculation.

Problem:
If 15% of y is the same as 21% of z, 
then 12.5% of y is what percent of z?

Solution:
(15/100) y = (21/100) z
y = (21/15) z
y = (7/5) z

Now, 
Let 12.5% of y = A % of z
    12.5% of y = A % of z
Substitute y = (7/5) z
12.5 % of y can be written as 1/8 of y after simplification

(1/8) √ó (7/5) z = A % of z 
A = (7/40) X 100
A = 17.5 %  ‚úÖ

üëçFinal Answer:
12.5% of y is 17.5% of z.
