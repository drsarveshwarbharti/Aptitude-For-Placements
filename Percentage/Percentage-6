Problem on Percentage-6 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of percentage and some basic calculation.

Problem:
Y has to score 40% marks to pass. 
He gets 20 marks and fails by 40 marks.
The maximum marks of the exam are?

Solution:
Assume maximum marks = 100 

Marks required to pass = 40% of 100
                       = 40/100 × 100
                       = 40

Y gets 20 marks and fails by 40 marks, so passing marks = Y’s marks + 40
                                                        = 20 + 40
                                                        = 60 

Find actual maximum marks
If 40% of maximum marks = 60, then
Maximum marks = 60 ÷ 40 × 100
              = 150 ✅

👍 Final Answer:
Maximum marks of the exam = 150
