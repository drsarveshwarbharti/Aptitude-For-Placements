Problem on Percentage-6 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of percentage and some basic calculation.

Problem:
Y has to score 40% marks to pass. 
He gets 20 marks and fails by 40 marks.
The maximum marks of the exam are?

Solution:
Assume maximum marks = 100x 

Marks required to pass = 40% of 100x
                       = 40/100 √ó 100x
                       = 40x

Y gets 20 marks and fails by 40 marks, so passing marks = Y‚Äôs marks + 40
                                                        = 20 + 40
                                                        = 60 

Find actual maximum marks
If 40x = 60, then
    x = 60 √∑ 40
    x = 1.5
Maximum marks = 100x = 100 √ó 1.5 = 150 ‚úÖ

üëç Final Answer:
Maximum marks of the exam = 150
