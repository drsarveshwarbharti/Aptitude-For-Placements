Problem on Percentage-1 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of percentage and some basic calculation.

Problem:
An employee’s salary is increased by 12% and
then decreased by 8%.
If the original salary is ₹100, 
find the net percentage change.

Solution:
Note: Net percentage change = ( New value - Old value / Old value ) x 100

Consider Original salary = 100

Increase by 12% 
12% of 100 = 12
New salary = 100 + 12 = 112

Decrease by 8%
8% of 112 =  8.96
New salary = 112 − 8.96 = 103.04

Compare with original
Original = 100,
Final = 103.04
Change = 103.04 − 100 = 3.04

Net percentage change is = (Change / Original Salary) x 100
                         = (3.04 / 100 ) x 100
                         = 3.04 % ✅

👍Final Answer:
Net percentage change is 3.04 %
