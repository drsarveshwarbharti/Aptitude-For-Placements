Problem on Probability-2 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of probability logics.

Problem:
A bag contains 5 red balls and 3 green balls.
One ball is picked at random.
What is the probability that the ball is red?

Solution: 
Note: Probability = Favourable outcomes √∑ Total outcomes

Total balls = 5 + 3 = 8
Number of favourable outcomes (red balls) = 5
Probability = Favourable outcomes √∑ Total outcomes
           = 5 √∑ 8 ‚úÖ

Final Answer:
üëç Probability of picking a red ball = 5/8
