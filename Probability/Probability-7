Problem on Probability-7 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of probability logics.

Problem:
A card is drawn at random from a pack of 52 cards.
What is the probability that it is 
(a) a red card, 
(b) a king,
(c) face card (Jack, Queen, King)
(d) Ace?

Solution:
Note: Probability = Total favourable outcomes/ Total outcomes

Total cards = 52
(a) Red cards in deck of cards = 26
Probability = 26 Ã· 52 = 1/2 âœ…

(b) Kings in deck of cards = 4 
Probability = 4 Ã· 52 = 1/13 âœ…

(c) 4 suits: â™¥ Hearts, â™¦ Diamonds, â™£ Clubs, â™  Spades
Each suit has 13 cards: A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K
The J (Jack), Q (Queen), and K (King) are called face cards because they have faces drawn on them.

Each suit has 3 face cards (J, Q, K)
Total = 3 Ã— 4 = 12 face cards in the whole pack
Face cards = 3 in each suit Ã— 4 suits = 12

Probability = 12 Ã· 52 = 3/13 âœ…

(d) The A (Ace) is the first card of every suit. 
    There are 4 suits then there would be 4 aces in a deck of card.
Aces = 4
Probability = 4 Ã· 52 = 1/13 âœ…

ðŸ‘‰Final Answer: 
Probability of Red cards =  1/2
Probability of Kings =  1/13
Probability of Face cards =  3/13
Probability of Ace =  1/13
