Problem on Probability-4 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of probability logics.

Problem:
At a traffic signal, the light can be Red, Yellow, or Green with equal chance.
What is the probability that the light will be 
(a) Red, 
(b) Not Green?

Solution: 
Note : Probability = Total favourable outcomes/ Total outcomes
Total possible outcomes = 3 (Red, Yellow, Green)

(a) Red
Favourable = 1 (Red)
Probability = Total favourable outcomes/ Total outcomes
Probability = 1 √∑ 3 = 1/3 ‚úÖ

(b) Not Green
Favourable = {Red, Yellow} = 2
Probability = Total favourable outcomes/ Total outcomes
Probability = 2 √∑ 3 = 2/3 ‚úÖ

Final Answer:
üëç (a) Probability of Red = 1/3
üëç (b) Probability of Not Green = 2/3
