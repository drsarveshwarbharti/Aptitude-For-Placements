Problem on Probability-1 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of probability logics.

Problem:
Two coins are tossed at the same time.
What is the probability of getting 
(a) two heads, 
(b) at least one head?

Solution: 
Note: Probability = Total favourable outcomes/ Total outcomes

When 2 coins are tossed 
Outcomes = {HH, HT, TH, TT}
So, total outcomes = 4

(a) Two heads:
Favourable outcomes = {HH} = 1
Probability = Total favourable outcomes/ Total outcomes
Probability = 1 √∑ 4 = 1/4 ‚úÖ

(b) At least one head:
Atleast one head means 1 or more heads so,
Favourable outcomes = {HH, HT, TH} = 3
Probability = Total favourable outcomes/ Total outcomes
Probability = 3 √∑ 4 = 3/4 ‚úÖ

Final Answer:
üëç (a) Probability of two heads = 1/4
üëç (b) Probability of at least one head = 3/4
