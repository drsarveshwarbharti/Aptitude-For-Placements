Problem on Probability-1 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of probability logics.

Problem:
Three fair coins are tossed simultaneously. 
Find the probability of getting atmost two heads.

Solution: 
Each coin can be Head (H) or Tail (T).
Sample Space S = {HHH,HHT,HTH,THH,HTT,THT,TTH,TTT}

“At most two heads” means 0, 1, or 2 heads. 
Total favourable outcomes = HHT,HTH,THH,HTT,THT,TTH,TTT 

Probability = Total favourable outcomes/ Total outcomes
Probability = 7/8 ✅

👉Final Answer: Probability of at most two heads = 7/8.
