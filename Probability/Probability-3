Problem on Probability-3 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of probability logics.

Problem:
A dice is thrown once.
What is the probability of getting (a) an even number, (b) a number greater than 4?

Solution: 
Note: Probability = Favourable outcomes ÷ Total outcomes

Total outcomes when a dice is thrown = 6
(Possible numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

(a) Even number:
Even numbers = {2, 4, 6} → 3 outcomes
Probability = Favourable outcomes ÷ Total outcomes
Probability = 3 ÷ 6 = 1/2 ✅

(b) Number greater than 4:
Numbers greater than 4 = {5, 6} → 2 outcomes
Probability = Favourable outcomes ÷ Total outcomes
Probability = 2 ÷ 6 = 1/3 ✅

Final Answer:
👍 (a) Probability of even number = 1/2
👍 (b) Probability of number greater than 4 = 1/3
