Problem on Number System-2 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of Number System.

Problem:
If one-third of one-fourth of a number is 15, then three-tenth of that number is

Solution:
Let the number = x

One-fourth of the number = x รท 4
One-third of that = (x รท 4) รท 3 = x รท 12

Given x รท 12 = 15
      x = 15 ร 12 = 180 โ

Now, three-tenth of that number = (3/10) ร 180
                                = 540 รท 10
                                = 54 โ

๐ Final Answer:
Three-tenth of the number = 54
