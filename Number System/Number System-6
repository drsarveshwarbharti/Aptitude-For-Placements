Problem on Number System-6 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of Number System.

Problem:
Find a positive number which when increased by 7 is equal to 30 times the reciprocal of the number.

Solution:

Let the number = x
Equation:
x + 7 = 30/x
x² + 7x = 30
x² + 7x − 30 = 0
(x + 10)(x − 3) = 0

So, x = −10 or x = 3

Take positive → x = 3 ✅

👍 Final Answer:
The required positive number = 3
