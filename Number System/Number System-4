Problem on Number System-4 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of Number System.

Problem:

The difference between a two-digit number and 
the number obtained by interchanging the positions of its digits is 36.
What is the difference between the two digits of that number?

Solution:
Note: A two-digit number is always represented in the form of 10x+y 
      where x is tens digit and
      y is ones digit.

Let the tens digit = x
Let the ones digit = y

So, the two-digit number = 10x + y
The number after interchanging = 10y + x

Difference = (10x + y) − (10y + x)
           = 9x − 9y
           = 9(x − y)
According to the question:
9(x − y) = 36
   x − y = 4 ✅

👍 Final Answer:
The difference between the two digits = 4
