Problem on Number System-3 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of Number System.

Problem:
Consider three consecutive odd integers
Three times the first integer is 3 more than twice the third. 
The third integer is:

Solution:
Let the first odd integer = x
Then, the next two consecutive odd integers are:
Second = x + 2
Third = x + 4

According to the problem:
3 √ó first integer = 2 √ó third + 3
3x = 2(x + 4) + 3
3x = 2x + 8 + 3
x = 11

So, third integer = x + 4 = 11 + 4 = 15 ‚úÖ

üëç Final Answer:
The third integer is 15
