NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of Number System.

Problem:
The HCF of two numbers is 18,
their LCM is 2340. 
If one of the numbers is 270, 
find the other number.

Solution:
Note: Formula is First number × Second number = HCF × LCM

Substitute values 270 × Second number = 18 x 2340
                        Second number = 156✅

👍 Final Answer: The other number is 156.
