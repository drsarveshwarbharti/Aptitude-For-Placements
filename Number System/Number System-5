Problem on Number System-5 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of Number System.

Problem:
The product of two numbers is 120 and the sum of their squares is 289. The sum of the numbers is:

Solution:
We know the identity:
(a + b)² = a² + b² + 2ab

Given:
a² + b² = 289
ab = 120

Now,
(a + b)² = 289 + 2 × 120
(a + b)² = 289 + 240 = 529 

So,
a + b = √529 = 23 ✅

👍 Final Answer:
The sum of the numbers = 23
