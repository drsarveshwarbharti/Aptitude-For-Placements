Time and work-4 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement (Infosys, TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of concepts of time, work and efficiency.

Problem:
4 men can complete a work in 12 days, and 6 boys can complete the same work in 12 days.
If 3 men and 9 boys work together, in how many days will they finish the work?

Solution: 

Work by 4 men in 12 days = Work by 6 boys in 12 days
So,
4M × 12 = 6B × 12
⇒ 4M = 6B
⇒ B = 2/3 M
