Ratio and Proportion-5 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement (Infosys, TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of concepts of percentage and simplification along with the concepts of ratio.

Problem:
The ratio of two numbers is 2 : 3
and their product is 726.
Find the two numbers.

Solution:
Let the numbers be 2x and 3x

Product = (2x) Ã— (3x) = 6xÂ²
(Given product = 726):
So according to the question:
6xÂ² = 726
 x = 11

First number = 2x = 2 Ã— 11 = 22
Second number = 3x = 3 Ã— 11 = 33 âœ…

Final Answer
ðŸ‘‰ The two numbers are 22 and 33
