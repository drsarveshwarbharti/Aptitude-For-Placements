Ratio and Proportion-1 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement (Infosys, TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of concepts of percentage and simplification along with the concepts of ratio.

Problem:
One number is 20% less than the third number,
and the second number is 40% less than the third number.
Find the ratio of the two numbers.

Solution:
(Assume third number = 100):
First number = 100 âˆ’ 20% of 100 = 80
Second number = 100 âˆ’ 40% of 100 = 60
Third number = 100

(Form the ratio):
First : Second  = 80 : 60 
                = 4 : 3 âœ…

Final Answer
ðŸ‘‰ The ratio of the two numbers is 4 : 3
