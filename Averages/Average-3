Problem on Average-3 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of average and some basic logic.

Problem:
The average of 6 numbers is 8.
What should be the 7th number so that the new average becomes 10?

Solution: 
Note: Formula of Average = Sum of observations / No. of observations.

Since average = ( sum ÷ number of observation ),
So, sum = (number of observation X average )
Original total sum of 6 numbers = 6 × 8 = 48

New total sum needed for 7 numbers = 7 × 10 = 70

7th number = 70 − 48 = 22 ✅

Final Answer
👍 The 7th number = 22
