Problem on Average-2 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of average and some basic logic.

Problem:
A family consist of grandparents, parents and grandchildren.
The average age of 2 grandparents is 67 years, the average age of 2 parents is 35 years, and the average age of 3 grandchildren is 6 years.
Find the average age of the whole family.

Solution: 
Note: Formula of Average = Sum of observations / No. of observations.

Total age of grandparents        = 2 × 67 = 134
Total age of parents             = 2 × 35 = 70
Total age of grandchildren       = 3 × 6 = 18

Original total age of family = 134 + 70 + 18 = 222
Total number of family members = 2 + 2 + 3 = 7

Average age of family = 222 ÷ 7 = 31.71 ✅

Final Answer:
👍 Average age of the family = 31.71 years (approx.)
