Problem on Averages-6 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of average and some basic logic.

Problem:
The average temperature of a week was calculated as 32°C. 
Later, it was realized that the temperature of Monday was taken as 30°C instead of 16°C.
Find the correct average temperature of the week.

Solution: 
Note: Formula of Average = Sum of observations / No. of observations.
      Sum of observations = Average X No. of observations

Here No. of observations is No. of days in week = 7
Average = 32
Original total sum = 7 × 32 = 224

Temperature was taken as 30°C instead of 16°C 
Error = 30 − 16 = 14
It means 14°C is the error that needs to be subtracted from the sum.
Correct total sum of temperature = 224 − 14 = 210

Correct average = 210 ÷ 7 = 30 ✅

Final Answer
👍 The correct average temperature of the week = 30°C
