Problem on Average-1 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of average and some basic logic.

Problem:
Find the average of all even numbers between 104 and 148.

Solution: 
Note: When the sequence forms Arithmetic Progression then
      average = (first term + last term) √∑ 2.
      AP (Arithmetic Progression) is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is always the same.

The even numbers between 104 and 148 are in an arithmetic sequence:
106, 108, 110, ‚Ä¶ , 146

In an arithmetic sequence, the average = (First term + Last term) √∑ 2
Average = (106 + 146) √∑ 2 = 252 √∑ 2 = 126 ‚úÖ

Final Answer
üëç The average of even numbers between 104 and 148 = 126
