Problem on Averages-4 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of average and some basic logic.

Problem:
The average weight of 8 persons increases by 2.5 kg when a new person comes in place of one of them weighing 65 kg.
Find the weight of the new person.

Solution: 
Note: Formula of Average = Sum of observations / No. of observations.

When the average increases by 2.5 kg, the total weight of all 8 persons increases by:
Increase in sum = 8 √ó 2.5 = 20

This extra 20 kg is because the new person is heavier than the one who left.
So,
Weight of new person = Weight of old person + Increase
                     = 65 + 20
                     = 85 ‚úÖ

Final Answer
üëç The weight of the new person = 85 kg.
