Problem on Average - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of average and some basic logic.

Problem:
The average weight of 30 students is 60 kg.
If one student leaves, the new average becomes 59 kg.
Find the weight of the student who left.

Solution: 
Original total weight =  30 * 60 = 1800

Now one student left so, number of students = 29
New total weight =  29 * 59 = 1711

Weight of the student who left = 1800−1711=89✅

Final Answer
👍Weight of the student who left = 89 kg.
