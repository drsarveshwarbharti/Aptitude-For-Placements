Problem on Averages-7 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of average and some basic logic.

Problem:
The average weight of 40 children in a class is 36.2 kg.
Three more children join the class with weights 42.3 kg, 39.7 kg, and 39.5 kg.
Find the new average weight of the class.

Solution: 
Note: Formula of Average = Sum of observations / No. of observations.
      Sum of observations = Averages X No. of observations.

Original total sum of weight = 40 √ó 36.2 = 1448

Now 3 children join, so their total sum of weight = 42.3 + 39.7 + 39.5 = 121.5

New total weight = Original total sum of weight + Sum of weight of three new children
New total weight = 1448 + 121.5 = 1569.5

New number of children = 43 ( 40 + 3 )

New average = 1569.5 √∑ 43 = 36.5 ‚úÖ

Final Answer
üëç New average weight of 43 children = 36.5 kg
