Time and work-2 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement (Infosys, TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of concepts of time, work and efficiency.

Problem:
A and B together can complete a piece of work in 10 days.
B and C together can complete it in 12 days.
C and A together can complete it in 15 days.
Find in how many days A, B, and C can complete the work if they work together.

Solution:
Note: Formula to be used to solve the problem
      Work = Efficiency x Time

(Take LCM for total work)
LCM of 10, 12, and 15 = 60 units of total work.

(Find efficiency of each pair)
A + B efficiency = 60 รท 10 = 6 units/day 
B + C efficiency = 60 รท 12 = 5 units/day 
C + A efficiency = 60 รท 15 = 4 units/day 

(Add all efficiencies)
(A + B) + (B + C) + (C + A) = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15

But this equals 2(A + B + C).
So, A + B + C efficiency = 15 รท 2 = 7.5 units/day 

(Time taken together)
Total Work รท Efficiency = 60 รท 7.5 = 8 days โ

Final Answer:
๐ A, B, and C will finish the work together in 8 days.
