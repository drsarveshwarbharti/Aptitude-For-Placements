Time and Work-3 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement (Infosys, TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of concepts of time, work and efficiency.

Problem:
Q can complete a work in 30 days.
Q is 25% more efficient than P.
Find the time taken by P alone to complete the same work.

Solution:
Note: Formula to be used to solve the problem
      Work = Efficiency x Time

(Assume efficiencies)
Let P‚Äôs efficiency = 100.
Then Q‚Äôs efficiency = 125 (since Q is 25% more efficient). 
Ratio of Efficiency of P : Q = 4 : 5

(Find total work using Q)
Work = Efficiency √ó Time
     = 5 √ó 30 = 150 units 

(Time taken by P)
Time = Work √∑ Efficiency of P
     = 150 √∑ 4 = 37.5 days‚úÖ

Final Answer:
üëçP alone can complete the work in 37.5 days.
