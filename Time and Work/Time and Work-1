Time and Work-1 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement (Infosys, TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of concepts of work and efficiency.

Problem: 
A can finish a piece of work in 15 days. 
B can finish the same work in 10 days. 
In how many days will they finish the same piece of work together?

Solution: 
Note: Formula to be used to solve the problem
      Work = Efficiency x Time

(Take LCM of 15 and 10 for total work):
LCM(15, 10) = 30 units of work (assumed total work).

(Find efficiency of each):
Aâ€™s 1 day work = 30 Ã· 15 = 2 units/day
Bâ€™s 1 day work = 30 Ã· 10 = 3 unit/day

(Work done together in 1 day):
2 + 3 = 5 units/day

(Total time = Total work Ã· Efficiency):
30 Ã· 5 = 6 daysâœ…

Final Answer
ðŸ‘‰A and B will finish the work together in 6 days.
