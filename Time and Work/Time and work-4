Time and Work-4 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement (Infosys, TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of concepts of time, work and efficiency.

Problem:
4 men can complete a work in 12 days, and 6 boys can complete the same work in 12 days.
If 3 men and 9 boys work together, in how many days will they finish the work?

Solution: 
Note: Formula to be used to solve the problem
      Work = Efficiency x Time

Work by 4 men in 12 days = Work by 6 boys in 12 days
So,
                4M √ó 12 = 6B √ó 12
                     4M = 6B
                      B = 2/3 M

Now, 9 boys = 9 √ó (2/3)M = 6 men.
So, 3 men + 9 boys = 3 men + 6 men = 9 men.
So, We have written boys in form of men.

Consider that 9 men takes y days to complete the work.
We can equate the equations again that include the men,
Work by 4 men in 12 days = Work by 9 men in x days
So,
                 4M √ó 12 = 9M x y
                       y = 5‚Öì days ‚úÖ (On cancelling M)

Final Answer: 
üëçThey will finish the work in 5‚Öì days.
