Problem on Profit & Loss-4 ‚Äì Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placements (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Capgemini, etc.) 
because it mixes marked price, discount, and selling price.

Problem:  
A sold a car to B at a profit of 25%. 
B incurred a loss of 15% while selling the same car to C.
A spent Rs. 50000 for this car. 
Find the price at which C bought it.

Solution:
Cost price for A = 50000

Selling price of A to B = CP + 25% of 50000
                        = 50000 + 25% of 50000
                        = 50000 + 12500
                        = 62500 

B sold to C at a loss of 15%, 
So selling price of B to C = CP ‚àí 15% of 62500
                          = 62500 ‚àí 15% of 62500
                          = 62500 ‚àí 9375
                          = 53125 ‚úÖ

üëç Final Answer:
C bought the car for Rs. 53125
