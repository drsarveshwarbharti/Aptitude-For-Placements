Problem on Profit & Loss-1 ‚Äì Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placements (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Capgemini, etc.) 
because it mixes marked price, discount, and selling price.

Problem
Ajay incurred a loss of 20% by selling a vase for Rs. 2880.
To get a profit of 20%, at what price should he sell the vase?

Solution
Let cost price (CP) = 100x 

Loss is calculated on Cost Price
Loss = 20% on CP
     = 20x

Selling price at 20% loss = CP - Loss
                          = 100x ‚àí 20x
                          = 80x
According to ques, SP = 2880
80x = 2880
x = 2880 √∑ 80
x = 36 
Cost price = 100x = 100 √ó 36 = 3600 ‚úÖ
Profit = 20% of CP
       = 20% of 3600

Selling price for 20% profit = Cost price + Profit
                            = 3600 + 720
                            = 4320 ‚úÖ

üëç Final Answer:
To get a profit of 20%, Ajay should sell the vase for Rs. 4320
