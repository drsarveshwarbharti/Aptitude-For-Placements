Problem on Profit & Loss-6 ‚Äì Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placements (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Capgemini, etc.) 
because it mixes marked price, discount, and selling price.

Problem
A shopkeeper earns a profit of 15% after selling a book at 20% discount on the printed price. 
Find the ratio of the cost price and printed price of the book.

Solution:
Let the printed price = 100x 

Selling price after 20% discount = 100x ‚àí 20% of 100x
                                 = 100x ‚àí 20x
                                 = 80x 
Let the cost price = 100y

Profit = 15% of cost price
       = 15% of 100y

Selling price = Cost price + Profit
80x = 100y + 15% of 100y
80x = 100y + 15y
80x = 115y

y : x = 80 : 115 = 16 : 23 ‚úÖ

üëç Final Answer:
The ratio of cost price to printed price = 16 : 23
