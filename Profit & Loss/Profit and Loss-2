Problem on Profit & Loss-2 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of profit and loss.

Problem:
A shopkeeper buys a shirt for ₹800. 
He marks its price 25% above the cost price. 
He then gives a 10% discount on the marked price and sells it.
Find profit percentage.

Solution:
Note: Profit % = (Profit/ CP) x 100

Find Marked Price (MP)
MP = CP + 25% of CP
MP= 800 + 25% ​× 800
MP= 1000

Apply discount of 10% on MP
Discount = 10% of 1000
Discount = 100

SP = MP − Discount 
SP= 1000−100 = 900

Profit = SP - CP
Profit = 900-800 = 100

Profit % = (Profit/ CP) x 100
Profit % = (100/800) x100 = 12.5% ✅

👍Final Answer: The Profit Percentage will be 12.5%
