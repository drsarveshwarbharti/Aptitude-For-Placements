Problem on Profit & Loss-7 ‚Äì Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placements (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Capgemini, etc.) 
because it mixes marked price, discount, and selling price.

Problem
A cheater manipulates his weighing machine so that it shows 1 kg for 970 grams. 
Find his profit percent.

Solution
Note: In case of manipulation profit percentage can be written as-
      Profit % = (Actual weight ‚àí Given weight) √∑ Given weight √ó 100

Let the cost price of 1 kg of goods = 100 (taking 1 kg as reference)

He actually gives 970 grams but charges for 1 kg.

Profit = (Actual weight ‚àí Given weight) √∑ Given weight √ó 100
Profit % = ((1000-970) √∑ 970) √ó 100
Profit % = (30 √∑ 970) √ó 100
         = 3/97 √ó 100
         ‚âà 3.09% (approx) ‚úÖ

üëç Final Answer:
Profit percent ‚âà 3.09%
