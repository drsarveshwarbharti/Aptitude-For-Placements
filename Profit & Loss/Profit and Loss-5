because it mixes marked price, discount, and selling price.

Problem
A fruit seller buys lemons at 2 for a rupee and sells them at 5 for 3 rupees. 
Find his gain percent.

Solution
Note: Gain % = (Gain / Cost price) X 100

Cost price of 2 lemons = 1 rupee
Cost price of 1 lemon = 1 √∑ 2 = 0.5 rupee 

Selling price of 5 lemons = 3 rupees
Selling price of 1 lemon = 3 √∑ 5 = 0.6 rupee 

Gain on 1 lemon = Selling price ‚àí Cost price
                = 0.6 ‚àí 0.5
                = 0.1 rupee 

Gain percent = (Gain √∑ Cost price) √ó 100
             = (0.1 √∑ 0.5) √ó 100
             = 20% ‚úÖ

üëç Final Answer:
Gain percent = 20%
