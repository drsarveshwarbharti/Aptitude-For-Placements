Ratio and Proportion-1 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement (Infosys, TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of concepts of percentage and simplification along with the concepts of ratio.

Problem:
One number is 20% more than a third number, 
and the second number is 50% more than the third number. 
Find the ratio of the three numbers.

Solution:
(Assume third number = 100):
First number = 100 + 20% of 100 = 120
Second number = 100 + 50% of 100 = 150
Third number = 100

(Form the ratio):
First : Second : Third = 120 : 150 : 100

(Simplify):
Divide by 10 â†’ 12 : 15 : 10âœ…

Final Answer
ðŸ‘‰The ratio of three numbers is 12 : 15 : 10
