Problem on Train-2 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement (Accenture, TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of distance, speed and time.

Problem:
A train runs at 54 km/h and passes a pole in 12 seconds.
Find the length of the train.

Solution:

(Distance):
When a train crosses a pole, the distance covered = length of the train

(Speed in m/sec):
We know that to change km/h into m/s, we multiply by 5/18.
So, 54 × (5/18) = 15 m/s.

Thus,
(Distance = Speed x Time)
15 × 12 = 180 meter.✅

Final Answer:
👍The train is 180 meters long.
