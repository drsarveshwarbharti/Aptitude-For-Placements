Profit & Loss â€“ Placement Exercise
Problem
A shopkeeper buys an article at a discount of 20% on the marked price. 
He then sells it at a price which is 20% more than the marked price. 
Find his profit percentage on the cost price.

Solution
Assume Marked Price (MP) = â‚¹100

Cost Price (CP):
Discount = 20% of 100 = 20
CP = 100 â€“ 20 = â‚¹80

Selling Price (SP):
SP = MP + 20% of MP = 100 + 20 = â‚¹120

Profit:
Profit = SP â€“ CP = 120 â€“ 80 = â‚¹40

Profit %:
Profit % = (Profit Ã· CP) Ã— 100 = (40 Ã· 80) Ã— 100 = 50% âœ…

Final Answer
ðŸ‘‰ The shopkeeper makes a 50% profit.

âš¡ This kind of question is very common in campus placements (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Capgemini, etc.) because it mixes marked price, discount, and selling price.
