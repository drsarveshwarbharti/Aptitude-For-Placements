Problem on Time, Speed and Distance-7 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of simple formula and calculations.

Problem:
Rohit drives from his home at a speed of 30 km/hr and reaches his bank 20 minutes late.
Then the next day he increases his speed by 15 km/hr but still he is late by 8 minutes.
How far is his bank from his home?

Solution:
Note:  Add times when one is late and one is early → because one increases time, the other decreases it
       Subtract times when both are late (or both early) → because we want the difference due to speed change
       Time = Distance ÷ Speed

Let the distance between home and bank = D km

Time difference between the two speeds = 20 − 8 = 12 minutes = 12/60 hours = 1/5 hours ✅

Time at 30 km/h − Time at 45 km/h = 1/5 hours
(D ÷ 30) − (D ÷ 45) = 1/5
Take LCM of 30 and 45 = 90
(3D − 2D) ÷ 90 = 1/5
D ÷ 90 = 1/5
D = 18 km ✅

👍 Final Answer:
Distance between Rohit’s home and bank = 18 km
