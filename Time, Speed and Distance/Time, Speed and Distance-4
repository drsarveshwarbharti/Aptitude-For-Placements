Problem on Time, Speed and Distance-4 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of simple formula and calculations.

Problem:
Rohit covers one-fourth of the total distance at 20 km/hr, 
one- fourth at 10 km/h and rest of his journey at 80 km/h. 
Find Rohit's average speed for the whole distance?

Solution:
Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.
Let total distance = 100x 

Distance 1 = 1/4 of 100x = 25x, 
Speed 1 = 20 km/h 
Time 1 = 25x √∑ 20 = 1.25x hours 

Distance 2 = 25x,
Speed 2 = 10 km/h 
Time 2 = 25x √∑ 10 = 2.5x hours 

Distance 3 = 50x,
Speed 3 = 80 km/h 
Time 3 = 50x √∑ 80 = 0.625x hours 

Total time = 1.25x + 2.5x + 0.625x = 4.375x hours ‚úÖ

Average speed = Total distance √∑ Total time
              = 100x √∑ 4.375x
              = 100 √∑ 4.375
              ‚âà 22.86 km/h ‚úÖ

üëç Final Answer:
Rohit‚Äôs average speed ‚âà 22.86 km/h
