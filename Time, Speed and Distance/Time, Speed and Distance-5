Problem on Time, Speed and Distance-5 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of simple formula and calculations.

Problem:
Pratik travels 96 kms at a speed of 16 km/hr using a bike, 124 kms at 31 km/h by car and another 105 kms at 7 km/h in horse cart. 
Then, find his average speed for the entire distance travelled?

Solution:
Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

Distance 1 = 96 km,
Speed 1 = 16 km/h 
Time 1 = 96 √∑ 16 = 6 hours 

Distance 2 = 124 km, 
Speed 2 = 31 km/h 
Time 2 = 124 √∑ 31 = 4 hours 

Distance 3 = 105 km,
Speed 3 = 7 km/h 
Time 3 = 105 √∑ 7 = 15 hours 

Total distance = 96 + 124 + 105 = 325 km 
Total time = 6 + 4 + 15 = 25 hours 

Average speed = Total distance √∑ Total time
              = 325 √∑ 25
              = 13 km/h ‚úÖ

üëç Final Answer:
Pratik‚Äôs average speed for the entire journey = 13 km/h
