Problem on Time, Speed and Distance-6 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of simple formula and calculations.

Problem:
Surendra travels from home to office. 
With an average speed of 50 km/h, he is late by 30 minutes.
With a speed of 60 km/h, he reaches 10 minutes early.
Find the distance between home and office.

Solution:
Note:  Add times when one is late and one is early ‚Üí because one increases time, the other decreases it
       Subtract times when both are late (or both early) ‚Üí because we want the difference due to speed change
       Time = Distance √∑ Speed
Let the distance between home and office = D km 

Time difference between the two speeds = 30 + 10 = 40 minutes = 40/60 hours = 2/3 hours ‚úÖ

Time = Distance √∑ Speed
Time at 50 km/h ‚àí Time at 60 km/h = 2/3 hours
(D √∑ 50) ‚àí (D √∑ 60) = 2/3

Take LCM of 50 and 60 = 300
(6D ‚àí 5D) √∑ 300 = 2/3
D √∑ 300 = 2/3
D = 300 √ó 2/3
D = 200 km ‚úÖ

üëç Final Answer:
Distance between home and office = 200 km
