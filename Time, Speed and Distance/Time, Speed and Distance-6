Problem on Time, Speed and Distance-6 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of simple formula and calculations.

Problem:
Surendra travels from home to office. 
With an average speed of 50 km/h, he is late by 30 minutes.
With a speed of 60 km/h, he reaches 10 minutes early.
Find the distance between home and office.

Solution:
Note: Time = Distance ÷ Speed
Let the distance between home and office = D km 

Time difference between the two speeds = 30 + 10 = 40 minutes = 40/60 hours = 2/3 hours ✅

Time = Distance ÷ Speed
Time at 50 km/h − Time at 60 km/h = 2/3 hours
(D ÷ 50) − (D ÷ 60) = 2/3

Take LCM of 50 and 60 = 300
(6D − 5D) ÷ 300 = 2/3
D ÷ 300 = 2/3
D = 300 × 2/3
D = 200 km ✅

👍 Final Answer:
Distance between home and office = 200 km
