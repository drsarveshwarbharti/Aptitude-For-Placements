Problem on Time, Speed and Distance-1 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of simple formula and calculations.

Problem:
A train travels 180 km at a speed of 60 km/h. 
On the return journey, its speed is 90 km/h.
Find the average speed of the train for the whole journey.

Solution:
For finding average speed for equal distances their is a formula
Avg Speed = (2 x S1 x S2) / (S1+ S2)

According to the question 
S1 = 60km/hr 
S2 = 90km/hr

Avg Speed = (2 x 60 x 90) /(60 + 90) = 72km/hr ‚úÖ

üëçFinal Answer: The average speed is 72 km/h.
