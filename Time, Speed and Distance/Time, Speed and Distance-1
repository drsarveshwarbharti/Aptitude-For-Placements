Problem on Time, Speed and Distance-1 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of simple formula and calculations.

Problem:
A car is running at a speed of 72 km/h. 
Find the time it will take to cover 6000 meters.

Solution:
Note: Distance = Speed X Time
Convert speed into m/s:
Speed = 72 √ó (1000 √∑ 3600) = 20 m/s 

Distance = 6000 m

Time = Distance √∑ Speed
    = 6000 √∑ 20
    = 300 seconds ‚úÖ

üëç Final Answer:
The car will take 300 seconds to cover 6000 m.
