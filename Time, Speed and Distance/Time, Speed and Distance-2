Problem on Time, Speed and Distance-2 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of simple formula and calculations.

Problem:
Ramesh sees a thief at a distance of 80 m. 
The thief runs at 5 m/s, and Ramesh chases him at 7 m/s. 
Find the distance the thief covers before Ramesh catches him.

Solution:
Note: Concept of relative speed:
If two objects move towards each other, relative speed = sum of their speeds.
If they move in the same direction, relative speed = difference of their speeds.

Relative speed of Ramesh with respect to the thief = 7 ‚àí 5 = 2 m/s 

Time taken to catch the thief = Distance √∑ Relative speed
                              = 80 √∑ 2
                              = 40 seconds 

Distance covered by the thief = Speed of thief √ó Time
                             = 5 √ó 40
                             = 200 m ‚úÖ

üëç Final Answer:
The thief covers 200 m before Ramesh catches him.
