Problem on Train-1 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement (Accenture, TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of distance, speed and time.

Problem:
A train 200 metres long runs at 60 km/hr. 
Find the time taken to cross a bridge 300 metres long.

Solution:
Note: Formula to be used to solve the problem: 
           Distance = Speed x Time
Therefore, Time = Distance / Speed

Now,
(Total distance):
Distance = length of train + length of bridge = 200 + 300 = 500 metres

(Speed in m/sec):
60 Ã— (1000/3600) = 60 Ã— (5/18) = 16.67 m/sec

Thus,
(Time = Distance Ã· Speed):
500 Ã· 16.67 â‰ˆ 30 secondsâœ…

Final Answer:
ðŸ‘‰Thus train takes 30 seconds to cross.
