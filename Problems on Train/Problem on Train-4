Problem on Train-4 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement (Accenture, TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of distance, speed and time.

Problem:
A train passes a pole in 10 seconds and
the same train passes a platform of length 200 meters in 30 seconds.
Find the speed of the train in m/s and the length of the train meters.

Solution:
Note: Formula to be used to solve the problem:
Distance = Speed √ó Time

(Train crossing the pole)
When a train crosses a pole, the distance covered = length of the train.
So, Length of train = Speed √ó 10

(Train crossing the platform)
When a train crosses a platform, the distance covered = length of train + length of platform.
So, Length of train + 200 = Speed √ó 30

(Equation formation)
From pole: Length of train = 10 √ó Speed
From platform: Length of train + 200 = 30 √ó Speed

(Substitute)
10 √ó Speed + 200 = 30 √ó Speed
200 = 20 √ó Speed
Speed = 10 m/s

(Length of train)
Length of train = 10 √ó Speed = 10 √ó 10 = 100 meters ‚úÖ

Final Answer:
üëçThe speed of the train is 10 m/s and the length of the train is 100 meters.
