Problem on Train-5 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement (Accenture, TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of distance, speed and time.

Problem:
Two trains are moving towards each other on parallel tracks. 
Train A is 150 meters long and runs at 54 km/h. 
Train B is 120 meters long and runs at 36 km/h. 
Find the time taken for the two trains to completely cross each other.

Solution:
Note: Formula to be used: 
      Distance = Speed √ó Time

Concept of relative speed:
If two objects move towards each other, their relative speed = sum of their speeds.
If they move in the same direction, their relative speed = difference of their speeds.

(Relative speed in m/s)
To convert km/h to m/s, multiply by 5/18.
Speed of Train A = 54 √ó (5/18) = 15 m/s.
Speed of Train B = 36 √ó (5/18) = 10 m/s.
Relative speed = 15 + 10 = 25 m/s (since trains move towards each other).

(Distance to be covered)
When two trains cross each other completely, distance covered = sum of their lengths = 150 + 120 = 270 meters.

(Time to cross)
Time = Distance √∑ Relative speed = 270 √∑ 25 = 10.8 seconds.‚úÖ

Final Answer:
üëçThe two trains will completely cross each other in 10.8 seconds.
