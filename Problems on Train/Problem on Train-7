Problem on Train-7 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement (Accenture, TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of distance, speed and time.

Problem:
Stations M and N are 276 km apart. 
Train A starts from M towards N at 30 km/h at the same time Train B starts from N towards M at 16 km/h.
Find after how many hours they meet

Solution:
Note: Formula to be used: 
      Distance = Speed √ó Time

Concept of relative speed:
If two objects move towards each other, their relative speed = sum of their speeds.
If they move in the same direction, their relative speed = difference of their speeds.

So, Relative speed = 30 + 16 = 46 km/h.
Time until meeting = Distance √∑ Relative speed = 276 √∑ 46 = 6 hours ‚úÖ

Final Answers:
üëç They meet after 6 hours.
