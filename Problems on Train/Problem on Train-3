Problem on Train-3 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement (Accenture, TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of distance, speed and time.

Problem:
A train of length 180 meters passes a pole in 12 seconds. 
After that, it passes a bridge in 30 seconds. 
Find the length of the bridge in meters.

Solution:
Note: Formula to be used to solve the problem:
Distance = Speed √ó Time

(Distance)
When a train crosses a pole, the distance covered = length of the train.
Distance = 180 meter.

Here, Time to cross a pole = 12 seconds

(Speed)
So, Speed = Distance √∑ Time = 180 √∑ 12 = 15 m/s.

(Time to cross the bridge)
When a train crosses a bridge, the distance covered = length of train + length of bridge.
Here, Time = 30 seconds and Speed = 15 m/s.

(Distance covered while crossing the bridge)
Distance = Speed √ó Time = 15 √ó 30 = 450 meters.

(Length of the bridge)
450 = 180 + Length of bridge
Length of bridge = 450 ‚Äì 180 = 270 meters ‚úÖ

Final Answer:
üëçThe length of the bridge is 270 meters.
