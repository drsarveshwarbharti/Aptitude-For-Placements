Problem on Train-6 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement (Accenture, TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of distance, speed and time.

Problem:
A train 180 meters long is running at 54 km/h. 
A man is walking on the track in the same direction at 6 km/h. 
Find the time taken by the train to completely cross the man.

Solution:
Note: Formula to be used: 
      Distance = Speed √ó Time

Concept of relative speed:
If two objects move towards each other, relative speed = sum of their speeds.
If they move in the same direction, relative speed = difference of their speeds.

(Relative speed in m/s)
Convert both speeds into m/s by multiplying with 5/18.
Train's speed = 54 √ó (5/18) = 15 m/s.
Man's speed = 6 √ó (5/18) = 5/3 ‚âà 1.67 m/s.
Relative speed = 15 ‚Äì 1.67 = 13.33 m/s.

(Distance to be covered)
The train has to cover its own length to cross the man = 180 meters.

(Time to cross)
Time = Distance √∑ Relative speed = 180 √∑ 13.33 ‚âà 13.5 seconds.‚úÖ

Final Answer
üëçThe train will completely cross the man in 13.5 seconds.
