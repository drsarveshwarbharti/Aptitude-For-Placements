Problem on Partnership-3 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of Partnership.

Problem:
P, Q, and R start a hotel. 
Q and R invest equally, but P invests only 1/5th of Q’s investment. 
At the end of one year, the profit is ₹22,000. 
Find Q’s share in the profit.

Solution:
Note: The profit is always divided in the same ratio as the investment ratio.

Let Q’s investment = ₹x.
Then R’s investment = ₹x (since Q and R invest equally).
P’s investment = (1/5) of Q = (1/5) * x = ₹x/5.

So, investment ratio of P : Q : R respectively = (x/5) : x : x = 1 : 5 : 5
Because when we divide each term by x/5, it simplifies to 1 : 5 : 5.

Total profit = ₹22,000
Total parts = 1 + 5 + 5 = 11 parts

Q’s share = (5/11) × 22,000 = ₹10,000 ✅

👍Final Answer: Q gets ₹10,000.
