Problem on Partnership-3 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of Partnership.

Problem:
Rohit starts an agency by investing ‚Çπ40,000. 
After 4 months, Raj joins with an investment of ‚Çπ50,000. 
At the end of one year, the total profit is ‚Çπ1,10,000. 
Find Raj‚Äôs share in the profit.

Solution:
Note: When the time of investment is different, 
we multiply each partner‚Äôs Investment by the time (in months) for which it was invested. 
Rest the logic is the same ‚Äî the ratio of (Investment √ó Time) will be the ratio in which the profit is divided.

Rohit‚Äôs investment = ‚Çπ40,000 for 12 months = 40,000 √ó 12 = 4,80,000
Raj‚Äôs investment = ‚Çπ50,000 for 8 months = 50,000 √ó 8 = 4,00,000
Investment Ratio = 4,80,000 : 4,00,000 = 6 : 5
So, Profit Sharing Ratio = 6  : 5

Total profit = ‚Çπ1,10,000
Total parts = 6 + 5 = 11 parts

Raj‚Äôs share = (5/11) √ó 1,10,000 = ‚Çπ50,000
Rohit‚Äôs share = (6/11) √ó 1,10,000 = ‚Çπ60,000 ‚úÖ

üëçFinal Answer: Raj gets ‚Çπ50,000 and Rohit gets ‚Çπ60,000.
