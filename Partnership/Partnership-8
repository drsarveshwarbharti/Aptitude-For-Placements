Problem on Partnership-8 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of Partnership.

Problem:
Ram and Shyam together invested ₹15,000 in a business. 
At the end of the year, the total profit was ₹2,000. 
Shyam got ₹600 as his share of profit. 
How much did Ram invest?

Solution:
Note: The profit is always divided in the same ratio as the investment ratio.

Given Total profit = ₹2,000
Shyam’s share = ₹600
Ram’s share = 2,000 − 600 = ₹1,400
So, profit ratio = Ram : Shyam = 1,400 : 600 = 14 : 6 = 7 : 3

Let Ram’s investment = ₹x
Then Shyam’s investment = ₹(15,000 − x)

Since profit is divided in the ratio of their investments,
so, ( x / 15000 - x ) = 7 / 3
                   3x = 7(15,000 − x)
                   3x = 1,05,000 − 7x
                    x = 10,500✅

👍Final Answer: Ram invests ₹10,500.
