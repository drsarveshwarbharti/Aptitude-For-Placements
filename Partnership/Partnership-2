Problem on Partnership-2 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of Partnership.

Problem:
P and Q buy a hotel. 
P invests 6 times what Q invests. 
At the end of one year, the total profit is ₹84,000. 
Find P’s share in the profit.

Solution:
Note: Profit is divided in the same ratio as the investments.

Let Q’s investment = ₹x.
Then P’s investment = ₹6x.
So, the investment ratio of P : Q = 6 : 1.

Since both invested for the same time, the profit will be divided in the ratio 6 : 1.

Total profit = ₹84,000
Total parts = 6 + 1 = 7 parts

P’s share = (6/7) × 84,000 = ₹72,000✅ 

👍Final Answer: P gets ₹72,000.
