Problem on Partnership-5 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of Partnership.

Problem:
M invests ‚Çπ4,000. 
After 3 months, N joins with ‚Çπ8,000 and P joins with ‚Çπ20,000.
At the end of one year, the profit-sharing ratio is given as 6 : 9 : 5,
The total profit is ‚Çπ1,12,000. 
Find the time of investment of P.

Solution:
Note: The profit is always divided in the same ratio as the investment ratio.

M‚Äôs investment = ‚Çπ4,000 for 12 months             = 4,000 √ó 12 = 48,000.
N‚Äôs investment = ‚Çπ8,000 for (12 ‚àí 3) = 9 months   = 8,000 √ó 9 = 72,000.
P‚Äôs investment = ‚Çπ20,000 for t months             = 20,000 √ó t.

Given ratio = 6 : 9 : 5, so
48,000 : 72,000 : (20,000 √ó t) = 6 : 9 : 5.

Since M and N already match the ratio 6 : 9, we only need to compare N and P to find P‚Äôs time.

So, compare N and P:
(72,000) / (20,000t) = 9 / 5
Cross multiplying:
72,000 √ó 5 = 9 √ó 20,000t
3,60,000 = 1,80,000t
t = 2

Therefore t = 2 months.‚úÖ

üëçFinal Answer: P invested for 2 months.
