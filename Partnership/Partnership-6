Problem on Partnership-6 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of Partnership.

Problem:
A and V invest in the ratio 5 : 2. 
After donating 10% of the profit to an orphanage, A gets ‚Çπ3,420 as profit. 
Find the total profit.

Solution:
Note: The profit is always divided in the same ratio as the investment ratio.

Since Investment ratio = Profit ratio = 5 : 2

Let total profit = 100x
Donation = 10% of 100x = 10x
Remaining profit = 100x ‚àí 10x = 90x

This 90x is divided in the ratio 5 : 2 because after donating, the remaining profit will be distributed.
So, A‚Äôs share = (5/7) √ó 90x = (450/7)x

Given A‚Äôs share = 3,420
So, (450/7)x = 3,420
           x = 53.2

Total profit = 100x = 100 √ó 53.2 = 5,320‚úÖ

üëçFinal Answer: The total profit = ‚Çπ5,320.
