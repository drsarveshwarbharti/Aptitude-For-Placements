Problem on Partnership-1 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of Partnership.

Problem:
A and B start a business. 
A invests ₹12,000 and B invests ₹8,000. 
At the end of one year, they earn a profit of ₹20,000. 
Find each person’s share in the profit.

Solution:
Note: The profit is always divided in the same ratio as the investment ratio.

A invests ₹12,000 and B invests ₹8,000. 
Investment ratio = 12000 : 8000 = 3 : 2.

Since both A and B invested their money for the same time period (1 year), 
the profit is divided in the same ratio as the investment ratio.

A’s share = (3/5) x 20,000 = ₹12,000. ✅
B’s share = (2/5) x 20,000 = ₹8,000.  ✅

👍Final Answer: A gets twelve 12,000 and B gets 8,000.
