Problem on Partnership-7 - Placement Exercise
NOTE: This kind of question is very common in campus placement ( TCS, Wipro, etc.) 
because it makes the use of Partnership.

Problem:
P and Q start a business by investing ₹20,000 and ₹40,000 respectively. 
At the end of one year, the total profit is ₹15,000. 
P also gets a fixed salary along with the profit share. 
If P’s total earning is ₹7,000, find the salary.

Solution:
Note: The profit is always divided in the same ratio as the investment ratio.
Salary will be distributed initially and after that profit is distributed in the profit sharing ratio.

P invests ₹20,000 and Q invests ₹40,000. 
Investment ratio = 20000 : 40000 = 1 : 2.

Total earnings includes salary and profit share.
Let P’s salary = ₹x
Then profit left for division = 15,000 − x

P’s share from profit = (1/3) × (15,000 − x)

Now, P’s total earning = Salary + Profit share
                       = x + (1/3)(15,000 − x)

Given P’s total earning = 7,000
    x + (15,000 − x)/3 = 7,000
   (3x + 15,000 − x)/3 = 7,000
                     x = 3,000 ✅

👍Final Answer: P’s salary = ₹3,000.
